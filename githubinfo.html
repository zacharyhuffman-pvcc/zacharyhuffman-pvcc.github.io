    <ul>
        <li>
           <p>Q: What is a version control system?
            A: A version control system (VCS) is software that tracks and manages changes to source code over time. It enables developers to see a history of modifications, including who made changes and when. This allows for easy collaboration and the ability to revert to previous versions if issues arise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is Git?
            A: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. Unlike traditional VCS, Git keeps snapshots of the entire repository at various points in time, rather than just saving changes to files.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is GitHub?
            A: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, enabling developers to host and share their code repositories. It serves as a social network for developers, facilitating collaboration on open-source projects and providing tools for issue tracking, code review, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Q: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
           A: Git is the underlying version control system that operates locally on a developer's machine, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: Who started GitHub and how was it started?
            A: GitHub was founded by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon in 2008. The founders created GitHub out of a desire to simplify the process of sharing and collaborating on code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
           <p>Q: What company owns it now?
            A: Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018 for $7.5 billion, integrating it into their development ecosystem while maintaining its independence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: How much does a GitHub account cost?
            A: GitHub offers several account types: Free, Team ($4 per user/month), and Enterprise ($21 per user/month).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Q: What is Octocat?
            A: Octocat is GitHub's mascot, depicted as a cat with octopus features. It symbolizes the playful spirit of the GitHub community.</p>
