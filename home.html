<h1>Oveview Of The Eighteenth Amendment</h1>

<p>

    The Eighteenth Amendment became a significant topic of public discourse following the Civil War. Many religious leaders and politically affluent individuals believed that the next pressing issue facing the United States was the societal ills of prostitution, gambling, and violence which were attribute to alcohol use. They argued that these problems were directly linked to the consumption of alcoholic beverages and not a broader issue. During this period, a substantial portion of the population rallied behind the idea of banning alcohol, giving rise to the Temperance movement. This movement gained momentum as it attracted a massive coalition of supporters, from religious leaders to social reformers, they all believed that prohibiting alcohol would lead to a more morally upstanding society.

    <br><br>
    
    As the Temperance movement evolved, its members achieved significant successes. By 1916, twenty-three states had enacted laws against alcohol, showing the widespread public support for prohibition. Encouraged by this momentum, these advocates turned their attention to Congress. Over the following years, they worked tirelessly to develop and ratify the Eighteenth Amendment. On January 16, 1919, this new amendment was officially ratified, making the “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors” illegal. However, due to various challenges, it would take another year for the amendment to be properly enforced.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    
    Yet, an important question loomed large: Would all alcohol be banned, even for special cases? If so, who would be allowed to use it, and under what circumstances? These questions highlighted the complexities of enforcing a blanket prohibition on alcohol. 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    
    On the same day the Eighteenth Amendment passed through Congress, the Volstead Act was also enacted. If the Eighteenth Amendment served as a shield protecting the public from alcohol, the Volstead Act was the sword that accompanied it, providing the legal framework for enforcement. It established the penalties for alcohol consumption and manufacturing, laying the groundwork for what would become a battle between the government and the general public. Surprisingly, Congress assigned the responsibility of enforcing this new amendment to the Treasury Department. The Prohibition Unit of the IRS, sometimes referred to as “prohibition cowboys,” was charged with the task of ensuring compliance. However, the federal government faced significant challenges, lacking both funding, adequate training for its enforcement agents and corruption which foreshadowed the eventual failure of Prohibition.
    <br> 
    <br>
    
    In its early years, Prohibition did appear effective. Alcohol consumption plummeted by a staggering 30 percent, with hard liquor consumption dropping even more dramatically by 50 percent. However, these statistics masked the rise and thriving black market for alcohol. Organized crime quickly filled the void left by the legal alcohol industry. Notorious, figures like Al Capone became synonymous with the illegal production and distribution of liquor, or bootlegging. By 1925, New York City alone was home to between 30,000 and 100,000 speakeasies, hidden bars where alcohol was served in defiance of the law.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    
    Despite the challenges, some individuals worked diligently to enforce Prohibition. Elliot Ness, the head of the Prohibition Unit, became famous for his targeted efforts to combat organized crime in Chicago. His unit was often referred to as untouchable because unlike other law enforcement they wouldn’t take bribes. Ness is credited with using tax evasion laws to bring down Al Capone, showcasing his drive to make a difference during this period of time. However, as Prohibition progressed, public sentiment began to shift negatively. The increases in gambling and prostitution that accompanied the ban on alcohol led to a growing realization that crime rates had risen in tandem with alcohol's absence. The very problems that had fueled the push for Prohibition were being exacerbated by it.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Ultimately, the Eighteenth Amendment was fully repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933, marking it as the only amendment in U.S. history to be completely overturned. The failures of Prohibition revealed the difficulties of passing laws driven by morality and the unintended consequences that often accompany enforcing a drastic change on the population. In the end, the attempt to eliminate alcohol from American life had far-reaching effects, shaping future discussions around government regulation, individual freedom and morality.
