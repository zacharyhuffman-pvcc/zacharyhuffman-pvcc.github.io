<h1>Oveview Of The Eighteenth Amendment</h1>

<p>

    The prohibition of alcohol became a significant talking point immediately following the Civil War; many religious leaders and politically affluent individuals believed that the next pressing issue facing the United States was the societal ills of prostitution, gambling, and growing violence which they attributed to alcohol use. They argued that these problems were directly linked to the consumption of alcoholic beverages and not a symptom of a broader issue. During this period, a substantial portion of the population rallied behind the idea of banning alcohol, giving rise to the <i>Temperance</i> movement. This movement gained momentum as religious leaders and social reformers were able to attract a massive coalition of supporters, they all believed that enacting a nationwide ban on alcohol would lead to a more morally upstanding society.

    <br><br>
    
    As the Temperance movement evolved, its members achieved even greater successes. By 1916, twenty-three states had enacted laws against alcohol, showing the widespread public support for prohibition. Encouraged by this momentum, these advocates turned their attention to Congress and now wanted a federal ruling on alcohol, sfter all nearly half of all states were already onboard. Over the following years, they worked tirelessly to develop and ratify an amendment to the Constitution, and soon they'd have it - the Eighteenth Amendment. On January 16, 1919, this new amendment was officially ratified, making the “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors” illegal. However, due to various challenges, it would take another year for the amendment to be properly enforceable.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    
    Yet, an important question loomed large: Would all alcohol be banned, even for special cases? If so, who would be allowed to use it, and under what circumstances? Who would enforce this new amendment? Would the states decide punishment or the Federel government? 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    
    On the same day the Eighteenth Amendment passed through Congress, the Volstead Act was also enacted. If the Eighteenth Amendment served as a shield protecting the public from evils of alcohol, the Volstead Act was the sword that accompanied it, providing the legal framework and establishing the penalties for alcohol consumption and manufacturing. Congress assigned the responsibility of enforcing this new amendment to the Treasury Department or The Internal Revenue Service as we know them. The Prohibition Unit of the IRS, sometimes referred to as “prohibition cowboys,” was charged with the task of ensuring compliance which for most, was either a large fine or jail time in more extreme cases. However, the federal government faced significant challenges, lacking both funding, adequate training for its enforcement agents and corruption from within and this would foreshadowed the eventual failure of Prohibition.
    <br> 
    <br>
    
    In its early years, Prohibition did appear effective. Alcohol consumption plummeted by a staggering 30 percent, with hard liquor consumption dropping even more dramatically by 50 percent. Also, an unintended side-effect of Prohibition, was the dairy market exploding; bars were frequently converted to ice cream shops and the Navy was one of the biggest converts. Fun fact, to this day every Navy ship has an ice cream machine onboard because the demand was so intense and it was a trend that just carried on through time. However, all of these statistics masked the rise and thriving black market and dark underground associated with alcohol. Organized crime quickly filled the void left by the legal alcohol industry. Notorious, figures like Al Capone became synonymous with the illegal production and distribution of liquor, or bootlegging and where theres a balck market there's violence over territory. Al Capone was directly linked to the, St. Valentines Day Massacare, where seven of his associates dresses like policemen and killed several rival gang members. By 1925, New York City alone was home to between 30,000 and 100,000 speakeasies, which were hidden bars where alcohol was served.
    Despite all of these new challenges, some individuals worked diligently to enforce Prohibition. Elliot Ness, the head of the Prohibition Unit, became famous for his targeted efforts to combat organized crime in Chicago, and being the direct nemesis to Al Capone. His unit was often referred to as untouchable because unlike other law enforcement agencies they wouldn’t take bribes, they weren't concerned with money they truly wanted to make a difference. Ness would eventually bring the Mob to its knees when he finally arrested Capone and in an ironic twist even though he was linked to many murders and the illegal distribution of alcohol, it was his tax evasion that would bring him to justice. As Prohibition progressed, public sentiment began to shift negatively. The federal and state governments realized quickly, they were missing out on crucial tax dollars, after all they shutdown an entire market. Also, a increase in gambling and prostitution accompanied the ban on alcohol and violence fueled the speakeasies from the background and this eventually led to a growing realization that crime rates had risen in tandem with alcohol's absence. The very problems that had encouraged the push for Prohibition were being exacerbated by it.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Ultimately, the Eighteenth Amendment was fully repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933, marking it as the only amendment in U.S. history to be completely overturned. The failures of Prohibition revealed the difficulties of passing laws driven by morality and the unintended consequences that often accompany enforcing such a drastic change on the population. In the end, the attempt to eliminate alcohol from American life had far-reaching effects, shaping future discussions around government regulation, individual freedom and morality. Also, once alcohol returned legally to the public the demand for dairy dropped drastically and the dairy market nearly collapsed if it weren't for the federal government stepping in to buy the excess. Eventually, this would lead to cheese bunkers in mountains and the development of government cheese but that's a story for another time.
